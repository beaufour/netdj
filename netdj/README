Brief description:
------------------
You will need to have some program that downloads mp3's for you. I use the
gnut Gnutella-client (http://www.gnutelliums.com/linux_unix/gnut/). It has a
cache function that downloads random files, and with my small patch
(gnut.patch) it will only cache .mp3-files.

NetDJ will then scan that directory and play the files in the order that
they are downloaded, if there's no files or it has played them all it will
play random files from you private (share) collection.

Need to have:
-------------
* POSIX threads
* GNU regex

Nice to have:
-------------
* GNU readline (well, I give no guarantees without this, but it compiles)
* libshout to stream through an icecast/shoutcast-server

Compile:
--------
1. ./configure
2. make

Configuration:
--------------
1. make install
2. edit /etc/netdj/*, or copy to ~/.netdj/ and edit there

Bug reports to: allan@beaufour.dk with NetDJ in subject.
