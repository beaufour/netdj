Missing
-------
ENGINE:
* Multiple shares
* Enable directories in lists (especially shares)
* Enable HTTP GET of songs
* Save history of played songs
  - a playlist history
  - check history before playing song (avoid too frequent repeats)
* FIX: Request doesn't work


APPLET:
* Show the ID3-info
* Show proper window instead of tooltip
* FIX: Crashes when there's only one song in the cache-list


ADMIN UI:
* Take generic player-command and args from config file
* Do generic full_path-function (with either pwd or home as added path)     
* Save (not move) file to share
* Delete should accept parameter current/previous/number
* Show current downloads (*.gnut)
* Show playlist for sharedir
* Show playingtime when showing songinfo
* Clear cache-list (set lastupdate = now());
* Show previous song
* Delete individual songs from playlist(s)
* Better playlist-listings
  - userchosen numbers
  - choose by listname
* Errorhandling should be made more flexible


WEB UI:
* Add 'search on freedb'
* Add commands from UI
  - add song
* Add support for more commands
* Add feedback to user for commands
* Add info about webusage on admin display
* Clean up songnames (in search line, or general?)
  - Remove '_' from filenames like Led_Zeppelin-The_Song_Remains_The_Same.mp3
  - Remove additional endings, .mp3.mp3, etc.
* FIX: There seems to some kind of error with /cgi-bin/-commands,
  they only work every second time - weird... timeout error of some sort


GNUT:
* real blacklist-function for the cache
* check for already existing files in all lists before caching
* Weird idea: connect only to host in a geographical area?


BIG ISSUES
----------
* Stream the sound to clients
* Do better seperation of UI and commands
* Prioritize playlistchoosing (fx. 60% from share, 40% cache)
* An idea: Full seperation of engine, player and UI so it's three different
  programs.
  - UI can be handled solely by HTML over HTTP (or XML over HTTP/SOAP).
  - Playing can be handled solely by streaming the data
* Handle wishes? Send requests through underlying file fetcher
  (ie. search for xxx on gnut, don't download, just search -- would
   maybe trigger caching...)
* Wild idea: Enable "news-hour", ie. every full our stream the news
  from you local netradio...
