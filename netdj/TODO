Coming up:
* Proper blacklist-function in Gnut
  - new 'cache <xxxxx>', just as 'search <xxxxx>'
  
* Multiple shares
  -> Switchingpriority?
  -> save/move should take listname as argument

* Switch to select deletion of files after playing (after xx numbers played)
  - should help Gnut cache new songs more quickly, or what?
  
Missing
-------
UI:
* Take generic player-command and args from config file
* Do generic full_path-function (with either pwd or home as added path)     
* Save (not move) file to share
* Delete should accept parameter current/previous/number
* Show current downloads (*.gnut)
* Show playlist for sharedir
* Show playingtime when showing songinfo
* Clear cache-list (set lastupdate = now());
* Show previous song
* Delete individual songs from playlist(s)
* Better playlist-listings
  - userchosen numbers
  - choose by listname
* Errorhandling should be made more flexible

WEB:
* Add 'search on freedb'
* Add commands from UI
  - add song
* Add support for:
  - more commands
  - ID3-info
  - index.xml
* Add feedback to user for commands
* Add info about webusage on admin display
* Clean up songnames (in search line, or general?)
  - Remove '_' from filenames like Led_Zeppelin-The_Song_Remains_The_Same.mp3
  - Remove additional endings, .mp3.mp3, etc.
  - Get ID3-tag, and use that
* FIX: Shutdown thread correctly, ie. close socket
* FIX: There seems to some kind of error with Opera and /cgi-bin/-commands,
  they only work every second time - weird... timeout error of some sort


GNUT:
* real blacklist-function for the cache
* check for already existing files in all lists before caching


BIG ISSUES
----------
* Stream the sound to clients
* Do better seperation of UI and commands
* Prioritize playlistchoosing (fx. 60% from share, 40% cache)
* An idea: Full seperation of engine, player and UI so it's three different
  programs.
  - UI can be handled solely by HTML over HTTP (or XML over HTTP/SOAP).
  - Playing can be handled solely by streaming the data
* Handle wishes? Send requests through underlying file fetcher
  (ie. search for xxx on gnut, don't download, just search -- would
   maybe trigger caching...)
* Wild idea: Enable "news-hour", ie. every full our stream the news
  from you local netradio...
