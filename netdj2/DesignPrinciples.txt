* Exceptions (StdException)
* Qt
* JavaDoc documentation style.
* Mozilla style naming: mMember, aParam, FunctionIsLikeThis()
* Use TagLib (http://ktown.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/api/) for file-based access
  -- has TagLib::AudioProperties::length() and sampleRate(), etc.!
* Everything is in the |NetDJ| namespace
* Uses signal/slots to log everything and to send commands bewteen threads
* All output goes to gLogger

Open issues:
* All output to?
  -- cin/cout/cerr/clog ??
  -- warnings from qWarning should be caught!
  -- events could be the answer?

* Database support throgh Qt? UnixODBC?
* Easy way to extend
  -- Via pure virtual interfaces
     - Implement new collections, etc.
     - How about rating system?
  -- Via central notification service?
     - Everybody can subscribe to whatever events they like.
  -- Via exposed server interface with commands for querying:
     - lists
     - song database
     - song information (part of list query?)
     - stream information, listeners, url, etc.?

* Use PAM as access checker?
