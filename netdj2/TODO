Remember:
- Fix comments
- Get STL and std::string out of the code...
- Check all todo's

Showstoppers:
- LogService should only run in Server context...
  -- PlayerThread emits SongPlaying, gets to LogService, gets to Server, needs
     to send it to all clients... ouch!
  -- Mutex and timer, or something?
  -- Queue LogEntries in Server?
  -- Would be better to queue them in LogService, more generic
  -- Seperate LogService thread would mean mutexes in Server too...
  -- Queue them in LogService and tend to them with a timer...
  -- use Events:
     - QApplication::postEvent()?
     - QCustomEvent
     - use events in general to signal from PlayerThread
     - that would need a MainLoop class that translates the event to a signal
- Get rid of SigException?
- Add EntryType = INFO, WARN, CRIT to log entries
- Add timestamp to log entries
- Parse command line parameters (popt?)
- Fork into background
- Default log file placement
- Network logging
- Refactor SongInfo to TagLib usage and future DB support
- Make sure that SongInfo is not always cached!

BUGS:
- Periodic segfault. Possibly weird characters in filenames/ID3

Major enhancements:
* Database support
* Support ogg
* Reencode files to CBR

Nice to have:
* Use SOAP for commands
