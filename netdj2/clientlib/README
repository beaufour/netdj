Purpose of the clientlib is:
----------------------------
1) Make a Qt library to receive log stream from engine and convert this to
   specific signals.
2) Should be as generic as possible so transport mechanism can be changed.
3) Should be an interface, so implementation can be changed.

Design plan:
------------
Two interfaces:
A) Gets information from NetDJ, and emits QDomElement* entries
B) Gets QDomElement* entry signals, and emits specific signals

Two implementations:
A) Interface to TCP stream
B) Well, implementation...

And finally:
A test GUI client that shows events in a nice dialog. Maybe a combined
curses/GUI client or an example app of both. getenv(DISPLAY)...
