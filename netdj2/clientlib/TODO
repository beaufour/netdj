* NetLogListener is QtHTTP implemenation of course
  - Another implementation is a KDE, KUrl-thingy, that uses the KDE UI to ask
    for credentials
  - Could make it even more generic, instead of sending out QDomElement it
    should send out std::string? Naaah, signal/slot... but it would be nice to
    have a non-Qt interface.
* INetDJClient should have a constructor that takes a ILogListener as an
  argument, and does the connect automatically... or the other way around?
